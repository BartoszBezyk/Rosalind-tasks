Bioinformatics tasks from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)

This repository contains tasks from the [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) platform. Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.  You will find descriptions of specific tasks in individual tasks.

The solutions to each task include code that loads the data file for the task (downloaded from the Rosalind platform) and then returns the solution file.
